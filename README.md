# How it's Made:

**Tech Used:** HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

HTML and CSS were used to create the form. When inputs were incorrect, error messages were generated using JavaScript.

# Lesson's Learned: 

I used more complicated CSS than I have used before, such as different CSS units, advanced selectors, CSS functions, downloadable fonts, and pseudo-classes. I gained knowledge on how to create a form in HTML.
